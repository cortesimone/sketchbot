This drawing machine is prodigally based on the open-source project _Makelangelo_.

* Teacher: Giorgio Olivero
* Tutor: Roberto Picerno
* Participants: Giannicola Baiardi, Michele Bozzi, Francesca Centonze, Fabrizio Goglia, Nicolò Loprieno, Simona Materazzini, Roberto Memoli.

In the _Hardware_ folder there are the vector files needed to lasercut the structure to hold in place the Arduino board and the stepper motors.  
In the _Software_ folder there are a couple of Processing sketches to convert freehand drawings and SVG files into GCODE, moreover there's a slightly edited version of the original Makelangelo firmware for Arduino.


The workshop was designed following an invitation to participate in the project "x — una variabile in cerca d’identità" by ff3300 and pazlab [ff3300.com/x](ff3300.com/x).  
August 2013.

Special thanks go to Antonio Ianiero and the [unterwelt.it](http://unterwlet.it) crew for the generous advice.
