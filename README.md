SketchBot workshop by [TODO](http://todo.to.it)

Video documentation of the workshop (August 2013).

This drawing machine is prodigally based on the open-source project _Makelangelo_.

In the _Hardware_ folder there are the vector files needed to lasercut the structure to hold in place the Arduino board, the Adafruit Motor Shield, the two stepper motors and the power supply.  
In the _Software_ folder there some Processing sketches to convert freehand drawings and SVG files into GCODE, moreover there's a slightly edited version of the original Makelangelo firmware for Arduino that is calibrated for our bobbins setup.

The workshop was designed following an invitation to participate in the project "X — una variabile in cerca d’identità" [ff3300.com/x](ff3300.com/x).
